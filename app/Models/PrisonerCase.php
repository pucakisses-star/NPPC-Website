     * were inside again — and the row that most often trips this is not even a
     * release: an escape is recorded as a release_date, because there is no
     * other column for the day custody ended. William Morales's Bellevue
     * escape (May 21, 1979) was auto-derived into "in exile since 1979",
     * alongside the real exile that began when Mexico flew him to Cuba in
     * 1988, and the two spans were then added together on his public profile.
     *
     * Only a guard on the derived value: an in_exile_since set explicitly by
     * a curator or a data script never reaches this, since the branch above
     * runs only when the field is empty.
     *
     * Note the ordering caveat — a case row saved before its later sibling
     * exists cannot see custody that has not been entered yet, so this stops
     * a bad value being re-derived (an admin edit, a recompute run) rather
     * than guaranteeing one was never written. Existing rows are corrected by
     * data script.
