/**
 * Total exile time for a single prisoner, as the union of their cases'
 * exile intervals.
 *
 * Imprisonment can be summed across case rows because custody stints are
 * disjoint by nature — you cannot be in two prisons at once. Exile cannot.
 * An open-ended exile row counts through to *today*, so two rows describing
 * the same ongoing exile each contribute the whole span from their own start
 * to the present, and the overlap is added twice.
 *
 * William Morales is what that looks like in public: his Bellevue-escape row
 * (in exile since 1979-05-21) and his Mexican-custody row (in exile since
 * 1988-06-24) were summed into "Time in Exile: 85 Years 3 Months 21 Days" —
 * 47 years plus 38 years — for a man who has lived in Cuba since 1988.
 *
 * Merging the intervals keeps genuinely separate exiles additive (a return
 * home and a later second departure are two disjoint spans and still add up)
 * while counting any shared stretch once.
